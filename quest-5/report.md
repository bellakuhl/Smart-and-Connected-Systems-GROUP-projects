## Summary

In this quest, we implemented a device that acts as a security key fob. When a button on the fob is pressed, the user's unique ID and code is sent to a security hub. The hub then checks that the ID and code match one saved in the system and logs this to a server hosted on a Raspberry Pi.

## Evaluation Criteria
