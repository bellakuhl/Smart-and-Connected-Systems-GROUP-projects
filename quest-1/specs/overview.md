# Retro Alarm Clock

This document outlines the different input and out components of the retro
alarm clock and how they are synchronized with the time keeping subsystem.

The various component specifications are in separate documents that will
be linked to as the components are introduced.

## Hardware Setup

To assemble the clock, connected the alphanumeric display via I2C. Connect the
minutes servo to GPIO 12 and the seconds hand to GPIO 27. The console I/O
is setup to run UART over USB.  Once the peripherals are setup and the chip is
flashed, the servros will rotate to the '0' position and will rotate clockwise
~90Â° from the starting position. Place the hands on the servo motors.


## Software Overview

The software for this clock is organized to run the state machine diagrammed below:

### Time Keeping

The data managed by the system includes:

* The clock time
* The alarm time
* The current state
* Whether the alarm is enabled or disabled

When in clock mode, the time management subsystem using a hardware timer trigger updates.
The full specification is in [Retro Clock Time Keeping Specification](./time_keeping.md)


### Input

The only external input available to a user is through a UART tty console connected
via USB. The console is responsible for allowing the user to take action on the
system including:

* Setting the clock time
* Setting the alarm time
* Enabling or disabling the alarm
* Dismissing an active alarm

See the [Retro Clock Console I/O Specification](./console_io.md) for details.


### Outputs

There are two outputs in this system, the clock hands and the alphanumeric display.
See the [Retro Clock Output Specification](./clock_outputs.md) for details.
