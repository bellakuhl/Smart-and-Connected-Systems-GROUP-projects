## Summary

(Any takers?)


## Evaluation Criteria

**Uses PID for speed control at 0.1 m/s**

Using the P in PID control, we periodically measure the speed
of left right wheel and the PID control will adjust the wheel speed.

**Stops within 10cm of the end**

The ultrasonic sensor is placed such that the front of the car + 10cm is
the minimum range of the sensor (30cm). When the car detects an object
less than 35cm in front of it, the car will stop.


**Uses alpha display to show current postion or speed**

The speed is printing to the alpha display every measurement period.


**Successfully transverses A-B in one go, no hits or nudges**

In our testing, it did so.
